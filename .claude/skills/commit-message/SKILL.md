description: >
  Build and create a git commit following this repository's established message
  format. Use when the user asks to "commit", "commit all changes", "commit and
  document", or similar. Also applicable when any agent (gemini-cli, codex,
  qwen, opencode, claude-code) needs to stage and commit a set of changes with
  a properly structured message.
version: 1.0.0

# Commit Message Skill

## Purpose

Stage all relevant changes and create a git commit whose message matches the
format already established in this repository: a conventional-commit subject
line followed by a structured body that groups changes by category.

This skill is intentionally written in plain, agent-agnostic language so it
can be followed by Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Qwen, opencode, or any
other LLM-based coding agent.

---

## Step 1 — Gather context

Run the following commands and keep their output in mind for the rest of the
process. Do not skip any of them.

```bash
# Learn the repo's commit message format and subject-line style
git log --oneline -10

# Identify every file that has changed since the last commit
git diff --stat HEAD

# See the full diff for changed files that need to be understood
git diff HEAD

# Confirm which branch you are on
git branch --show-current
```

---

## Step 2 — Determine the commit type

Inspect the nature of the changes and pick exactly one conventional-commit
type prefix that fits:

| Prefix   | Use when                                                        |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`   | A new feature or capability is added                           |
| `fix`    | A bug, warning, or incorrect behavior is corrected             |
| `chore`  | Build system, dependencies, CI, or tooling changes             |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no functional change                |
| `test`   | Tests added or updated                                         |
| `docs`   | Documentation only                                             |
| `perf`   | Performance improvements                                       |
| `style`  | Formatting/whitespace with no logic change                     |

If the changes span multiple types but share a single theme (e.g., fixing
many warnings across many files), use the dominant type (`fix`) and document
the breadth in the body.

---

## Step 3 — Write the subject line

Format: `<type>: <short imperative summary>`

Rules:
- 72 characters maximum.
- Imperative mood ("fix", "add", "remove" — not "fixed", "adds", "removes").
- No trailing period.
- Specific enough to distinguish this commit from adjacent commits in
  `git log --oneline`.

Examples from this repo:
```
fix: silence compiler warnings across GCC and Clang
fix: silence compiler warnings in RI pipeline
fix: clang warnings and thread linkage
chore: add project identity macros and use them
test: split teapot motion for raytrace and REYES
```

---

## Step 4 — Write the body

The body follows the subject line after **one blank line**. It must:

1. **Open with a one-sentence description** of the overall goal or motivation
   (the "why", not the "what").

2. **Group individual changes by category**, each group introduced with a
   short heading followed by bullet points. Category examples:
   - Warning class (e.g., `-Wsequence-point`, `-Wunused-result`)
   - Subsystem (e.g., `CMake / Clang alignment`, `Build system`)
   - Feature area (e.g., `Shader pipeline`, `Network layer`)

3. **List files or modules affected** within each bullet, concisely. Prefer
   naming patterns over individual filenames when many files share the same
   fix (e.g., "brickmap.cpp, debug.cpp, texture.cpp" or "all fread() callers
   in the RI pipeline").

4. **End with the attribution line** (see Step 6) separated by a blank line.

Body line width: 72 characters maximum (wrap prose, but keep code snippets on
one line even if longer).

---

## Step 5 — Stage files

Stage specific files by name. **Do not use `git add -A` or `git add .`**
unless you have verified that every untracked file in the working tree should
be committed.

Never stage:
- `.env` files or any file that may contain credentials or secrets
- Binary build artifacts (`*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`)
- IDE workspace files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`)
- CMake build directory contents (`build/`, `CMakeCache.txt`, etc.)

Inspect `git status` and `git diff --stat HEAD` to identify exactly which
files belong to this commit.

---

## Step 6 — Create the commit

Use a HEREDOC to pass the message so multi-line formatting is preserved
exactly as written. Replace `<Agent Name>` and `<agent@email>` with the
appropriate attribution for the agent performing the commit.

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <subject line>

<one-sentence motivation / overall goal>

<Category heading 1>:
  - <change description, files affected>
  - <change description, files affected>

<Category heading 2>:
  - <change description, files affected>

Co-Authored-By: <Agent Name> <agent@email>
EOF
)"
```

**Attribution values by agent:**

| Agent        | Co-Authored-By line                                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Claude Code  | `Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`                     |
| Gemini CLI   | `Gemini CLI <noreply@google.com>`                               |
| Codex        | `OpenAI Codex <noreply@openai.com>`                             |
| Qwen         | `Qwen Agent <noreply@alibaba-inc.com>`                          |
| opencode     | `opencode Agent <noreply@sst.dev>`                              |

---

## Step 7 — Verify

After the commit succeeds, run:

```bash
git log --oneline -3
```

Confirm the new commit appears at the top with the correct subject line and
that `git status` shows a clean working tree (or only intentionally unstaged
files).

## Complete example

This is the exact commit produced for the warning-fixes batch in this
repository. Use it as a reference for tone, level of detail, and grouping
structure:

```
fix: silence compiler warnings across GCC and Clang

Systematically eliminate all -Wall/-Wextra/-Wpedantic warnings produced
by GCC 13 on Linux and align Clang/AppleClang flag coverage to surface
the same diagnostics on macOS builds.

Warning categories addressed:

- -Wsequence-point / -Wunsequenced: fix *ptr++ = (*ptr) * k UB pattern
  in renderer.h, curves.cpp, bsplinePatchgrid.cpp, patches.cpp,
  subdivision.cpp; replace with local capture before increment

- -Wunused-result (fread): wrap all discarded fread() calls in if()
  checks with /* read error */ body across brickmap.cpp, debug.cpp,
  precomp.cpp, texture.cpp, texmake.cpp, fileResource.cpp,
  irradiance.cpp, remoteChannel.cpp, rendererNetwork.cpp, show.cpp,
  map.h (template — fixes all instantiation sites at once)

- -Wmaybe-uninitialized / -Wuninitialized: add = nullptr / = 0 / = {}
  initializers to variables in execute.cpp, executeMisc.cpp,
  shaderOpcodes.h, shaderFunctions.h, giFunctions.h, surface.cpp,
  linsys.cpp, occlusion.cpp, polygons.cpp, pointHierarchy.cpp,
  stochasticQuad.h

- -Wdeprecated-declarations: replace libtiff uint32/uint16 typedef
  aliases with uint32_t/uint16_t in texture.cpp and texmake.cpp

- -Wformat-truncation: resize buffers in sdr.y (tmp[]) and
  rendererFiles.cpp (tmp[OS_MAX_PATH_LENGTH+1])

- -Wimplicit-fallthrough: add __attribute__((fallthrough)) in fbx.cpp,
  pp1.c, pp2.c; fix sl.y null-pointer init

- -Wempty-body: wrap assert(FALSE) else-branches in braces in
  rendererDeclerations.cpp

- -Wsign-compare: cast fread return comparison to size_t in texture.cpp

- -Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess: replace sizeof(scratch) with
  ribOutScratchSize in ribOut.h; add extern declaration

- -Wunknown-pragmas: guard #pragma clang diagnostic in ri.cpp with
  #ifdef __clang__

- -Wunused-variable: move invBezier/dinvBezier from patchUtils.h into
  the single .cpp that uses each; fixes a real copy-paste bug in
  quadrics.cpp (Pstart written instead of Pend for motion blur)

CMake / Clang alignment (CMakeLists.txt, src/oshader/CMakeLists.txt):
  add -Wunused-but-set-variable, -Wunsequenced, -Wimplicit-fallthrough
  for Clang/AppleClang so the same diagnostic categories surface on
  macOS builds without loosening any existing flags

## Quick-reference checklist

Before running `git commit`, confirm:

- [ ] `git log --oneline -10` reviewed — subject style matches repo conventions
- [ ] Subject line ≤ 72 chars, imperative mood, correct `type:` prefix
- [ ] Body opens with a motivation sentence
- [ ] Changes grouped by category with bullet points
- [ ] No secrets, binaries, or build artifacts staged
- [ ] `Co-Authored-By:` line present with correct agent identity
- [ ] HEREDOC used to pass the message (preserves newlines)
